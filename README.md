# About

Hi, this is my small repository to briefly showcase some of my skills in data analytics.

I am skilled in many data analytics tools and languages including Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft Excel, R, Python and SQL.
I will be adding a demo R and Python project to this repository within the coming week.

# SQL

Using the Northwind database with PostgreSQL, I have created a number of SQL queries with varying degrees of complexity to answer common queries that would be posed by sales teams, procurement teams, and HR teams.

The file with all of the SQL queries can be viewed here: https://github.com/Vevlyn/Portfolio_projects/blob/main/SQL_examples.sql
